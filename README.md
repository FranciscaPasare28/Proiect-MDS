# Hotel Management System
</hr>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This application is a hotel management system and offers the essential services for carrying out its activities.</br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After you have passed the initial screen and logged in with the credentials generated by the manager within the application, you will be directed to the menu that offers you the possibility to carry out the activity. The services are divided into 3 categories: management, reception and cleaning.</br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The manager deals with the management of the employees and the hotel rooms. It also has access to all other services offered by the application for flexibility.</br>
The reception can make reservations for customers, through which the room becomes unavailable for a certain period. Other services are the check-in and checkout service and placing a request for room cleaning at the request of the customers.</br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The cleaning part has access to an interactive menu through which they can select the rooms they have cleaned and in which they can view the clean rooms.</br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The application offers an intuitive interface, so that the staff can successfully carry out their work without technical impediments.:smiley:</br>
